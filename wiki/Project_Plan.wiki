#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements
= Goals =

 * develop a model of book-organizing process, that could be implemented in various OO-languages. *Result:* requirements, specifications, open CASE-program models (Rational Rose/StarUML, EMF, Netbeans, etc).

 * implement an extensible desktop book organizer. *Result:* desktop gui-application

 * implement an extensible mobile book reader. *Result:* mobile application

= Stages =

 # Elaborating mean requirements and specification.
 # Developing a desktop gui-application, satisfying this specification.
 # Integrating it with related free desktop applications (readers, openoffice, etc). Probably integrating with web.
 # Porting it to pda. Rise of linux and google andriod communicators requires a cross-platform application. If development of java-midlet fails, consider porting to .NET CF or PyCE.
 # Developing a simple pda-bookreader. Target feature: making notes on books, available for other programs. Odt-format suits for that.
