= Abstract =

Digital books are spreading more rapidly every day. With a transition from an old media to the new - appear the new ways of structuring (and that means - of understanding) the information contained by those media. The computers with their developing organization are attracting us to elaborate those ways. Such a demand is clearly seen today. Look at this [http://code.google.com/p/jbookshelf/wiki/Analogs list]: many OO-language coders had an idea of developing a digital texts organizing program this year. The development is slow for some reasons. However at least one such program is accomplished. This fact showed that such projects are effective and could be further developed. It also provided examples how to do and how not to do.
