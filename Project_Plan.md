Not all goals succeeded, so it's time to change the Plan.

# Goals #

  * **(DONE)** develop a model of book-organizing process. **Result:** basic requirements, use case model, emf data model. **Problem:** mobile platforms do not support emf.
  * **(DONE)** implement an extensible desktop book organizer **Result:** java-swing application
  * **(DONE)** port an existing swing-application to qt-jambi, so it could help to implement more features and make desktop app more handy
  * improve application until emf-model becomes stable
  * consider porting to pda again - with converting emf classes into simple java classes

Old Plan:

# Goals #

  * develop a model of book-organizing process, that could be implemented in various OO-languages. **Result:** requirements, specifications, open CASE-program models (Rational Rose/StarUML, EMF, Netbeans, etc).

  * implement an extensible desktop book organizer. **Result:** desktop gui-application

  * implement an extensible mobile book reader. **Result:** mobile application

# Stages #

  1. Elaborating mean requirements and specification.
  1. Developing a desktop gui-application, satisfying this specification.
  1. Integrating it with related free desktop applications (readers, openoffice, etc). Probably integrating with web.
  1. Porting it to pda. Rise of linux and google andriod communicators requires a cross-platform application. If development of java-midlet fails, consider porting to .NET CF or PyCE.
  1. Developing a simple pda-bookreader. Target feature: making notes on books, available for other programs. Odt-format suits for that.
