1. .Net CF
* port model and controller to c# using emf4net(http://wiki.eclipse.org/EMF4Net_Proposal)
* write .Net CF application using SharpDevelop

+ native WinCE interface
- possible bugs of emf4net (project is raw)
- lowest portability
- project splits into java and c#

2. AWT
* write gui using AWT
* run under Mysaifu JVM(http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~dat/java/project/jvm/index_en.html) on WinCE
* run under ported J2SE on Openmoko

+ easy to port
- poor gui
- possible bugs of Mysaifu (project is raw)
- to run application you need to open Mysaifu, then open application from it

3. (preferred) J2ME + LWUIT 
* write gui based on J2ME using LWUIT library (https://lwuit.dev.java.net/) that allows touch-screen support
* run under mobile jvm 

+ rich gui
+ high portability
- possible bugs of LWUIT
